## 🩺 Executive Summary
**VITALIS** (Versatile Intelligent Thoracic Acoustic Lung Inference System) is an low-cost, offline AI diagnostic tool. It is engineered as a attachment that fits onto standard analog stethoscope. 

By capturing acoustic pulmonary data and processing it locally via Edge-AI, VITALIS identifies respiratory anomalies (Wheezes, Crackles, Rhonchi) in real-time. It is specifically designed to empower NGO field workers and frontline health staff in resource-depleted environments to perform rapid medical identification without requiring an internet connection or an on-site pulmonologist.

## 🌍 Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
This project is purpose-built to address the "Last Mile" healthcare gap, actively targeting three primary UN SDGs:

### 1. SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
* **The Problem:** Respiratory diseases are leading causes of mortality in rural areas due to misdiagnosis.
* **The VITALIS Solution:** Providing an automated "second opinion" for lung disease for early detection and timely intervention.

### 2. SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
* **The Problem:** Commercial digital stethoscopes are prohibitively expensive
* **The VITALIS Solution:** Utilizes "Edge Computing" via neural networks to provide diagnostic infrastructure with zero INTERNET dependency.

### 3. SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
* **The Problem:** Severe disparity in diagnostic quality between urban hospitals and rural clinics.
* **The VITALIS Solution:** Democratizes medical technology by upgrading standard analog equipment into digital diagnostic nodes using affordable MEMS microphones.

## ⚙️ System Architecture & Workflow
VITALIS operates on a completely localized, closed-loop pipeline ensuring 100% patient data privacy.

1. **Acoustic Listening:** Analog lung sounds are captured via the stethoscope chest-piece and routed to INMP441 microphone sensor.
2. **Digital Conversion:** The **INMP441 I2S MEMS Microphone** samples the audio at high precesion, converting acoustic sound into digital I2S data.
3. **DSP & Feature Extraction:** The MCU buffers audio in 1000ms windows and calculates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to seperate the sound types.
4. **AI Inference:** The extracted features are fed into the neural network Trained on EDGE Impulse.
5. **Output UI:** The predicted respiratory state is displayed on the **Mobile App** through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

### Validation Metrics
* **Overall Accuracy:** 80.7%
* **Overall F1 Score:** 0.80
* **Training Depth:** 600 Epochs
* **Optimization:** Quantized (int8) to operate within the SRAM constraints of the ESP32 ecosystem.
